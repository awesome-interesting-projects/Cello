# Cello
A Cells Inside(tm) desktop UI framework rendered by OpenGL 

## WARNING! WARNING!
This is a real framework once used to support a full-blown desktop version of tiltonsalgebra.com, but that was ten years ago.

Full resurrection left as an exercise. Porting to WebGL would be so cool. Using ClojureScript...be still my beating heart.

Ping me if curious.
