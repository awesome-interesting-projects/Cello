Thanks and congrats to David Steuber for mandelbrot3.gif, which appears in
the same directory as this file. The fractal image was produced as part of
David's early explorations of Lisp, and he has graciously given his permission
for its inclusion as one of the sample image files for Cello.

You can find it in the demos in the scroller demo and as one of the textures 
you can apply to the shapes in the light-panel demo.

David asked that I also let folks know he is making it generally available (with

I think the creativecommons.html I grabbed from the Web and is in this same directory 
should be readable as well.
